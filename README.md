# Integrative Analysis of Molecular Subtypes in Acute Myeloid Leukemia

_Repository: aml-epi-transcriptome-integration_  

An R-based, automated, and reproducible workflow for integrated DNA methylation and RNA-seq analysis in acute myeloid leukemia. Implements differential methylation (DMG) and expression (DEG) comparisons between NPM1-mutant and PML-RARA fusion subtypes from the Beat AML cohort, with modular design such that adapter files can be added to extend the pipeline to other AML subtypes or datasets.
